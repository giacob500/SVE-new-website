## SVE B2B Website

The website is available at **https://studiovertueur.com/**

The website is still under development and it was built to prodie a business-to-business ecommerce platform for SVE s.r.l.

### Repo structure

The repo contains two folders:
- **testsite_wordpress**: A website based on wordpress which has not been developed. Originally the author was considering using Wordpress to produce the website.
- **testsitecodedbyme**: The actual implementation of the website which is now live, based on the programming languages below.

### Development

The website is developed using Pyhthon Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The domain was purchased on [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) and the website is currently hosted on a Virtual Private Server provided by [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/).
The Vultr server is running Ubuntu server and I used [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) and [Gunicorn](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/#) for the website deployment.
